			<p>Habibie's childhood was spent with his siblings in Pare-Pare, South Sulawesi. Habibie has shown a firm nature in adhering to principles since childhood. Habibie, who has a passion for horse riding, had to lose his father, who died on September 3, 1950, due to a heart attack.

Soeharto handed over the presidency to Habibie based on Article 8 of the 1945 Constitution. Until finally Habibie was also forced to resign due to the East Timor referendum which chose independence. His accountability speech was rejected by the MPR RI. He also returned to being an ordinary citizen and again moved to Germany.</p>
